  abstract: We describe an algorithm for barrier synchronization that requires only read and write to shared store. The algorithm is faster than the traditional locked counter approach for two processors and has an attractive log2N time scaling for larger N. The algorithm is free of hot spots and critical regions and requires a shared memory bandwidth which grows linearly with N, the number of participating processors. We verify the technique using both a real shared memory multiprocessor, for numbers of processors up to 30, and a shared memory multiprocessor simulator, for numbers of processors up to 256.

  abstract: >
    Busy-wait techniques are heavily used for mutual exclusion and barrier synchronization
    in shared-memory parallel programs. Unfortunately, typical implementations of
    busy-waiting tend to produce large amounts of memory and interconnect contention,
    introducing performance bottlenecks that become markedly more pronounced as applications scale.
    We argue that this problem is not fundamental, and that one can in fact construct
    busy-wait synchronization algorithms that induce no memory or interconnect contention.
    The key to these algorithms is for every processor to spin on separate locally-accessible
    flag variables, and for some other processor to terminate the spin with a single remote
    write operation at an appropriate time. Flag variables may be locally-accessible as a
    result of coherent caching, or by virtue of allocation in the local portion of physically
    distributed shared memory. We present a new scalable algorithm for spin locks that generates
    O(1) remote references per lock acquisition, independent of the number of processors
    attempting to acquire the lock. Our algorithm provides reasonable latency in the absence
    of contention, requires only a constant amount of space per lock, and requires no hardware
    support other than a swap-with-memory instruction. We also present a new scalable barrier
    algorithm that generates O(1) remote references per processor reaching the barrier, and
    observe that two previously-known barriers can likewise be cast in a form that spins only
    on locally-accessible flag variables. None of these barrier algorithms requires hardware
    support beyond the usual atomicity of memory reads and writes. We compare the performance
    of our scalable algorithms with other software approaches to busy-wait synchronization
    on both a Sequent Symmetry and a BBN Butterfly. Our principal conclusion is that contention
    due to synchronization need not be a problem in large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors.
    The existence of scalable algorithms greatly weakens the case for costly special-purpose
    hardware support for synchronization, and provides a case against so-called “dance hall”
    architectures, in which shared memory locations are equally far from all processors.
